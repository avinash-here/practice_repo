		// Introduction to Java
		
		// Java was developed by James Gosling in 1995 in SunMicro Systems.
		// Later it was acquired by Oracle Corporation in 2010.
		// At first it was named "OAK", later named "Green" and finally named 'Java', inspired 
		// from the java coffee. That's why we see a cup of coffee in its logo.
		
		// Java has 3 editions:
		// JSE : Java Standard Edition
		// JEE : Java Enterprise Edition
		// JME : Java Micro Edition
		
		// JSE is the base of other two editions.
		
		// To develop and run java applications, one must have JDK software in his/her PC.
		// JDK (Java Development Kit) is also known as Java Standard Development Kit.
