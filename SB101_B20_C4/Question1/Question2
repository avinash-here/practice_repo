 How many types of relationships exist among tables in the Database?
 Explain with some examples, and also mention how to establish these relationships among tables with example.
 
 There are three types of relationships exist among the tables in the Database.
 
 a. One To One relationship
 b. One To Many or Many To One relationship
 c. Many to Many relationship
 
 a. One To One : It is used to create a relationship between two tables in which a single row
    of the first table can only be related to one and only one records of the second table. 
    Similarly, a row of the second table can also be related to only one row of the first table.
    Example : One person may have only one Aadhaar card and one aadhaar card can be assigned to only one person.
    
    
 b. One To Many :  It is used to create a relationship between two tables. Any single row of
    the first table can be related to one or more rows of the second tables, but the rows of
    second tables can only relate to the only row of the first table.
    Example : One person may have many ATM Cards but an ATM card may have only one holder.
    
    
 c. Many To Many :  In this type of relationship, a record of the first table can relate to any number
    of records of the second table. Similarly, each record of the second table can also relate to more
    than one record of the first table.
    Example : One person can do many projects and one projects can be assigned to many persons.
